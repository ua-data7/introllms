Are you thinking about integrating ChatGPT and OpenAI into your coursework?

There is already a large list of potential uses for ChatGPT in higher education.

Read about [:simple-openai: OpenAI Educator Considerations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/chatgpt-education/educator-considerations-for-chatgpt){target=_blank}

ChatGPT's `GPT-3.5-turbo` and `GPT-4` models can compose essays and pass advanced knowledge assessments [(OpenAI :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.08774){target=_blank}.  Online education, a recent and lucrative innovation in academia, now faces challenges regarding effective remote student assessment [(Susnjak :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.09292){target=_blank}. 

Attempting to modify coursework to avoid assessment techniques where ChatGPT excels or using [bots to detect ChatGPT generated content](https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier){target=_blank} may prove to be futile. Instead of engaging in a cheating arms race, why not embrace ChatGPT and other AI frameworks?

Proponents of integrating ChatGPT into educational curricula [(:simple-newyorktimes:)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html){target=_blank} argue that by adapting and integrating ChatGPT into the curriculum, we can develop a modern workforce empowered by AI assistants. I find myself aligned with this perspective (as does my AI text editor, ChatGPT-4).

## Guiding Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Researchers in AI Usage

Training the next generation of researchers to use AI effectively and ethically is a crucial aspect of graduate mentorship. As an advisor, it is important to ensure that students have appropriate access to these platforms and a comprehensive understanding of the ethical implications for their education, research, and software engineering.

Platforms like ChatGPT could potentially become the primary mentor for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Unlike human advisors, these AI systems are available 24/7 to address virtually any question or problem. However, it is essential to strike a balance between AI assistance and independent learning.

To achieve this balance, advisors should:

**Encourage AI literacy**: Provide students with resources and opportunities to learn about AI technologies, their applications, and their limitations.

**Teach responsible AI usage**: Emphasize the importance of using AI as a tool to support research, not replace critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

**Discuss ethical considerations**: Foster open discussions about the ethical implications of AI in research, including issues of bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

**Promote collaboration**: Encourage students to collaborate with AI, leveraging its strengths to overcome their weaknesses and vice versa.

**Stay updated**: As AI technologies continue to evolve, ensure that both advisors and students stay informed about the latest developments, best practices, and potential pitfalls.

By incorporating AI into graduate and postdoctoral training while maintaining a focus on ethics and responsibility, the next generation of researchers can harness the power of AI to advance their fields while upholding the highest standards of academic integrity.

## Use of ChatGPT and Bard to support teachers

[ChatGPT 3.5](https://chat.openai.com/) is an AI chatbot that has been available since November 
2022. It has the potential to revolutionize education systems, but it's 
also a threat. Some people have tried to ban ChatGPT in schools, while 
others believe it's the "silver bullet" solution to many education 
challenges around the world. The exact impact of the chatbot on the 
sector is unclear.

Skeptics say chatbots harm learning, but they disrupt traditional 
tools like essay writing. With a shortage of 69 million teachers 
worldwide, could ChatGPT or Bard supplement or replace them? The launch of 
ChatGPT and Bard show potential to replace some human tasks. Are teachers an 
exception? Can chatbots complete tasks currently done by teachers? What 
are the risks? How can teachers use ChatGPT and Bard to improve their practice 
and efficiency?

## Opportunities of using ChatGPT and Bard as a learning tool

* **Enhance lessons**. In low- and middle-income 
countries, teachers face the challenge of making a dense curriculum 
engaging. To help with this, ChatGPT/Bard can translate learning objectives 
into lesson plans, offer ideas for class preparation, and aid in 
creating new assignments and assessments. However, ChatGPT/Bard does not 
assist with delivery, so teachers must still have strong teaching skills
 to ensure quality lessons.
* **Create assessment questions**. ChatGPT/Bard can help 
teachers improve assessment questions and generate multiple-choice 
items. It can also encourage higher-order thinking skills by providing 
prompts for essay questions and practical tasks. By using different 
types of assessment, teachers can help students develop critical 
thinking, problem-solving, and collaborative skills.
* **Support with language barriers**. The ideal scenario 
is for teachers to instruct in their native language, but some education
 systems are shifting towards teaching in a second language, such as 
English, even when evidence suggests the opposite approach. In such 
situations, teachers who are not proficient in English struggle to teach
 effectively. A proposed solution is the use of chatbots to enhance 
teachers' language proficiency, enabling them to teach better in both 
their native and a foreign language. Tools like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and ChatGPT 
reportedly provide affordable, accessible, and highly personalized 
language lessons.
* **Provide additional support to students**. ChatGPT/Bard can
 be used by teachers to encourage student curiosity and generate ideas 
for homework assignments. AI tools are particularly helpful in 
identifying the source information used in the chats. However, there is a
 risk that students may ask the chat to complete their homework for them
 instead of seeking help. To address this risk and teach about 
integrity, teachers can discuss the limitations of these tools, such as 
privacy risks, bias, and hallucination. Furthermore, teachers should 
focus on questions that cannot be answered by ChatGPT, such as those 
that require knowledge outside of the chatbot's training data, such as 
human emotions or subjective perspectives.
* **Grading assessment and papers**. ChatGPT/Bard can be used 
to automatically grade multiple-choice/one-answer tests; it can also 
help teachers with standards-based grading.  This has potential 
unintended consequences for low accuracy, poor grading, or false positive
 proctoring (mistakenly red-flagging students for cheating). When 
considering systems for proctoring or grading, it is critical to take 
measures to secure fairness, accountability, confidentiality, and 
transparency of their algorithms whenever needed.
