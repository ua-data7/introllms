Go to 8/15/2023 Workshop Agenda \u00b6 Welcome to our documentation on generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) prompt engineering and application integration in academic research and education. Generative AI is transforming the way we work, learn, and teach at the UArizona. To make the most of this revolutionary technology, you'll need to master the art of creating effective \"prompts\", the messages or requests that guide the ChatGPT's (or Bard's and Bing's) responses. Learning Objectives After the lesson, you should be able to: * Explain why generative AI matters in education, research, and society * Create effective prompts in ChatGPT, Bing, Bard, and other GPTs * Understand how and when to use AI assistants in your daily work Getting Started \u00b6 Getting Started with ChatGPT Getting Started with Bing Chat ChatGPT is integrated into Microsoft's Edge Browser via Bing Chat . Getting Started with Bard Chat Google's competitor, LaMDA , is featured in Bard . General Productivity \u00b6 Go to our lesson on Daily Productivity with GPTs The most likely interaction you will have (or have already had) with generative AI , Transformers , and Large Language Models (LLMs) is with OpenAI's ChatGPT . Predictive text and auto completion are becoming more common in productivity software. Generative AI powered applications are making their way into everyday software like Word Processors, SMS text messaging, and spreadsheets. LLMs are also being released into productivity software like Microsoft Office 365 w/ CoPilot and Google's Docs and Sheets Workspace . Education \u00b6 Go to our lesson on AI in the Classroom Go to our lesson on Ethics Research \u00b6 Research applications of generative AI and LLMs are broad. We obviously won't be able to teach all of them here, but hopefully this is an effective jumping off point: Programming Go to our lesson on GitHub CoPilot Go to our lesson on the OpenAI API Applications Go to our lesson on OpenAI API Powered Extensions Go to our lesson on HuggingFace Models Go to our lesson on HuggingFace Datasets Go to our lesson on Gradio UI Glossary Google's Machine Learning Glossary NVIDIA's Data Science Glossary BARD - Google's general purpose LLM Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) - is a family of masked-language models introduced in 2018 by researchers at Google , (Devlin et al. ) ChatGPT - OpenAI's general purpose LLM CoPilot - GitHub (Microsoft/OpenAI) AI co-programmer, natively integrated as an extension in VS Code or GitHub CodeSpaces Embeddings - process of transforming high-dimensional data, such as text or images, into low-dimensional vectors.

How do GPTs Work? \u00b6 Read the ChatGPT Documentation Read the ChatGPT Technical Report Read the Bard Documentation ChatGPT's GPT-3.5 and GPT-v4 models use natural language prompts to elicit contextual responses. GPTs can respond to either langauge (prose) or computer code. Other LLM models (like DALL-E or MidJourney ) produce images based on prompts. GPTs use a syntax called MarkDown . Markdown is plain text that uses special characters for formatting. This website, for example, is written using MarkDown syntax ( MkDocs-Material ) and converted to HTML using Python. Prompt Writing \u00b6 GPT Chat asks for a message to begin its conversation. These messages are called \"Prompts\". Begin a conversation with a specific type of prompt. This will help narrow the potential range of responses and improve results to subsequent prompts. Priming \u00b6 GPTs do better when provided with \"prompt primers\". Zero-shot unconditioned prompts are likely to return the least specific responses. Responses are more likely to be useful when multiple specific output types are defined. Types of Priming Example Zero (Shot) \"Write five examples of assessments for watershed health.\" Single \"Write five examples of assessments for watershed health. Here is one example: Geomorphology\" Multiple \"Write five examples of assessments for watershed health related to geomorphology, water quality, and species diversity.\" How long can or should a prompt be? The length of a prompt is measured in \"tokens\" . A token can represent an individual character, a word, or a subword depending on the specific tokenization approach. A rough estimate for the average number of words in English language per token is 0.75 . Currently, ChatGPT version GPT-3.5turbo uses up to 2,048 tokens per prompt, GPT-4 and Bing Chat can take up to 32,768 tokens. BARD currently has a limit of 20,000 tokens in a prompt. This means that a 2,048 token prompt would be equivalent to about 1,536 words (3-6 pages), and a 32,768 token prompt would be 24,576 words (50-100 pages). However, this is only an approximation and may vary depending on the specific text and model. What this also means is that current GPT are not capable of reading many PDFs at one time, for example, to do a literature review, or to write a sequel to a novel or book series. Prompt Structure \u00b6 Role Task Format Act as [ROLE] Create a [TASK] ... show as [FORMAT] Your prompt should specify the role in which ChatGPT responds, what its task is, and the format of how its outputs should be returned. A second step to the initial prompt is to link or chain your subsequent prompts. This lesson only covers ChatGPT, but the same prompt techniques can be used in other LLMs. ChatGPT Awesome Lists There is an ever changing meta-list of Awesome lists curated around ChatGPT plugins and extensions. search: chatgpt+awesome Check out lists around: ChatGPT Prompts ChatGPT Data Science Prompts API plugins, extensions, & applications Role \u00b6 Set the role for ChatGPT to play during your session. \"I want you to act as ...\" will establish what type of conversation you are planning to have. Types of Role Project Manager Copywriter / Editor Paper Reviewer Teacher / Mentor / Advisor Student / Learner / Participant Software Engineer DevOps Engineer Linux Terminal Python Interpreter Web Browser Examples of roles you might ask for are: a domain science expert, an IT or DevOps engineer, software programmer, journal editor, paper reviewer, mentor, teacher, or student. You can even instruct ChatGPT to respond as though it were a Linux terminal , a web browser, a search engine, or language interpreter. Data Scientist Let's try an example prompt with role-playing to help write code in the R programming language. I want you to act as a data scientist with complete knowledge of the R language, the TidyVerse, and RStudio. Write the code required to create a new R project environment, Download and load the Palmer Penguins dataset, and plot regressions of body mass, bill length, and width for the species of Penguins in the dataset. Your response output should be in R and RMarkDown format with text and code delineated with ``` blocks. At the beginning of new file make sure to install any RStudio system dependencies and R libraries that Palmer Penguins requires. Example can use GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4 Talk to Dead Scientists Try to ask a question with and without Internet access enabled: I want you to respond as though you are the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot Explain the relationship of lacunarity and fractal dimension for a self-affine series Show your results using mathematical equations in LaTeX or MathJax style format Again, there is no guarantee that the results ChatGPT provides are factual, but it does greatly improve the odds that they are relevant to the prompt. Most importantly, these extensions provide citations for their results, allowing you to research the results yourself. Custom Instructions \u00b6 Rolled out to subscribing users in July 2023, Custom Instructions is a more explicit way to set roles and specify how you want ChatGPT to respond. Tasks \u00b6 Prompts which return informative responses to questions like \"What is ...\" or \"How does ...\" Because of ChatGPT's proclivity at making up information, using it without a way of validating the authenticity of its responses makes it less trustworthy than regular search engines. Types of Task Scientific Article Essay Blog Post Outline Email Cover Letter Recipe Tutorial Lesson Plan Jupyter Notebook Configuration Code Software Script Bing and Bard fill an important space in these types of prompts - they return websites which match the query criterion and allow you to research your own answers. There are extension tools for ChatGPT which allows you to prompt with references. Access the Internet By default, ChatGPT does not have access to the Internet, and is limited to the time period before September 2021 (as of mid-2023) for its training data time frame. There are third-party extensions, like WebChatGPT which you can install in your browser (Firefox or Chrome), that will extend OpenAI ChatGPT's reach to the internet. We presently recommend using Bing Chat with Edge Browser instead of ChatGPT 3.5 for prompting which works with the internet. Bard also has access to the web and limited integration with Google Workspace. Format \u00b6 By default ChatGPT outputs MarkDown syntax text. It can also output software code, and soon images, video, music and sounds. Formats to output MarkDown Text (\\& emojis) List Table HTML CSS Regular Expression CSV / TXT JSON Rich Text Gantt Chart Word Cloud Graphs Spreadsheets You can also ask ChatGPT to explain complex topics or to act as a cook-book step-by-step guide. ChatGPT can provide instructional details about how to do specific tasks. Documentation Writer I want you to act as a DIY expert. You will help me develop the skills necessary to complete simple lab documentation, create tutorials and guides for beginners and experts, and explain complex concepts in layman's terms using visual techniques, and develop helpful resources. I want you to create a tutorial for building and deploying a github.io website using the MkDocs Material Theme Linked Prompts \u00b6 Follow-up your prompts sequentially. Responses to prompts may not return the exact details or information that you are after the first time. Follow-up by rephrasing your prompts more carefully and continuing with iterative prompting can build upon your priors. \"Chain prompting\" or \"Linked Prompting\" brings multiple prompts together. Linked Prompting Examples Step 1: Priming \"I want you to act as an eminent hydrologist from CUASHI. Provide me with a list of the ten most important topics in hydrology over the last decade focused around research in the global south, working with indigenous communities, and traditional ecological knowledge systems.\" Step 2: Summarizing \"Based on the list you just created, summarize the most pressing financial challenges faced by indigenous communities in the Global South, versus indigenous communities in North America, in less than 50 words.\" Step 3: Try again with enabled WebChatGPT or Browsing \"Based on the results of web access, can you confirm the validity of the ten important topics and provide at least one reference to each.\" Instructional You can also ask ChatGPT to explain complex topics or to act as a cook-book step-by-step guide. ChatGPT can provide instructional details about how to do specific tasks. ChatGPT as a documentation writer I want you to act as a DIY expert. You will help me develop the skills necessary to complete simple lab documentation, create tutorials and guides for beginners and experts, and explain complex concepts in layman's terms using visual techniques, and develop helpful resources. I want you to create a tutorial for building and deploying a github.io website using the MkDocs Material Theme General Prompt Traits \u00b6 Strategies Keep these W's in mind when writing prompts W's Reasons Who do you want ChatGPT to role-play: an engineer, an editor, a teacher, or a student? What is the specific context of your prompts? When is the specific time period of interest? Specify if so. Where is the geographic region or conceptual area? In what way do you want ChatGPT to respond: in a programming language, code, text-to-image? Syntax Use MarkDown syntax in your prompts. For code examples use single backtick ` or triple ``` for block quotes when adding your own code to your prompts. Context Develop a clear context around which you are seeking responses. Types of prompt help to establish the context of the responses you will recieve. Precision Keep your prompts precise and use clear language. Constrain the topic areas for which you wish your repsonses to be drawn from. Simplicity Break down your prompts into simple tasks which do not contain too many complex tasks or ones that require rationalization. Indirect Prompt Injection and Malware One of the risks of allowing LLMs and GPTs to access our personal documents and email clients involves the use of malware and malicious attacks. Indirect prompt injection Software Development \u00b6 ChatGPT is trained on langauges, including software language. Use ChatGPT as your new paired-programming AI assistant. Go to our lesson on GitHub CoPilot For novice programmers, ChatGPT likely fills a long unfilled hole in your knowledge map. It can write code faster than you can, and with the proper prompts, create programs in minutes which may have taken you hours or days. Linux Guru ChatGPT is trained on common data science languages, like Python, Julia, and R. Use ChatGPT to help develop basic code or to explain and debug code you're trying to write. Using ChatGPT can be a time savings, reducing the time it takes to look for the answers yourself over conventional search. I want you to act as a humble data scientist who works a lot with Python and scientific visualization Create a Python script which generates a visually pleasing and compelling heat map for a CSV dataset You can also use it to summarize code or to help explain its operation I want you to act as a humble data scientist who works a lot with Linux Explain to me what the following code does: $ find /home/www \\( -type d -name .git -prune \\) -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/subdomainA\\.example\\.com/subdomainB.example.com/g' Other valuable uses: Change variable names and file names! When you have a large dataset with many files and folder names, you can ask ChatGPT to help design a schema for renaming your project's content Regular Expressions, or regex is a bane of many programmers. ChatGPT can write, edit, and explain complex regex I want you to act as a regex generator. Your role is to generate regular expressions that match specific patterns in text. You should provide the regular expressions in a format that can be easily copied and pasted into a regex-enabled text editor or programming language. Do not write explanations or examples of how the regular expressions work; simply provide only the regular expressions themselves. remove any numbers from a string and replace them with a capital X For more advanced programmers, ChatGPT's weaknesses may become apparent when optimizing or linting complex code bases. However, there are already extension tools which can evaluate code performance and make changes or suggestions. DevOps Engineer ChatGPT can automate tasks and write tests I want you to act as a DevOps engineer who specializes in SQL and Docker. I am running an Ubuntu 22.04 server with a dockerized web service which appears to have a memory leak. Write a unit test for the PostgreSQL web server using SQL, JSON, or Python that can find the process which is causing the leak and restart the docker-compose service. You can also use ChatGPT to help optimize your code's performance. Make this code run faster and use less memory using BASH ``` import os # folder path dir_path = os.getcwd() # list to store files res = [] # Iterate directory for path in os.listdir(dir_path): # check if current path is a file if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir_path, path)): res.append(path) print(res) ``` Word Processing \u00b6 Outlining ChatGPT can help to create outlines for any type of writing. This can help get beyond a blank page problem. Getting ideas on paper Create a basic outline about an idea that you want to work on Create a title and sections for a student data challenge with three sections and no more than three subsections each. The challenge should be about using Earth Observation System data from NASA and European Space Agency to diagnose environmental change and human societies. Editing Proof-reading, removing passive voice, rewording for clarity and readability are all potential features that can be prompted from ChatGPT. When establishing the role of the responses, consider Summarizing When small or large groups are working together to synthesize discussions around scientific research, they often maintain the discussion topics in large sets of notes with many contributions. Use ChatGPT to summaries a day or a week's worth of notes. Include the schedule or agenda and ask ChatGPT to summarize whether the agenda met the topics of interest, or even suggest directions which went unexplored. Translation ChatGPT can be used for translating languages, and for specifying regional dialect translation. Althought it was not specifically designed for language translation, it does a relatively good job at most major languages to English. For English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers, ChatGPT utility in writing more formal or professional text is likely of high value. Writing While it is unethical to allow ChatGPT to write original research on your behalf, you can use it to help write technical documentation, recipes, or how-to-lists for yourself or a lab group. You can use also ChatGPT to draft email responses or to write letters, although doing so autonomously is unprofessional and potentially unethical conduct. ChatGPT timing out without completing its responses? When generating a long set of results, ChatGPT may time out after 60 seconds. You can resume the output of the prompt by telling it to 'continue'. For text: continue or for code response: continue ``` Tuning \u00b6 You can include Linux command line flags in your prompts, Parameter name Use Description Answers -a or --answers Specifies the number of output answers (default is 1) Category -c or --category Specifies the category of prompt (coding, creative, factual, fun, general, music, news, science, sports and writing) Format -f or --format Specifies the format of output (\"html\", \"markdown\", \"plain text\", other) Language -l or --language Specifies the required language of output Size -s or --size Specifies the maximum number of characters in the output Temperature -t or --temperature Control the creativity of output. The higher the temperature will result in more creative output (maybe less coherent). The temperature can be any value between 0 and 1 (default may be 0.5) Assessment \u00b6 How long can a prompt be? Well, it depends A good rule of thumb, depending on the platform, is at most 1,500 words or 3-5 pages of text. For larger, newer GPTs the length of a prompt may be up to 100 pages. True or False: ChatGPT has access to web browsing by default False ChatGPT cannot access the internet and is only trained until current events in September of 2021 Alpha Plugins for ChatGPT have browsing, but are waitlisted. Third-party plugins like WebChatGPT can enable browsing, but its results are not optimal. Bing Chat, and Bard both have access to the internet, and can generate responses to current events. Short, concise, prompts are better than long meandering prompts? it depends Prompts should be specific, but they do not necessarily need to be concise. Zero-shot prompts are less likely to return an accurate response than one where you prime the model, establishing a role, a task, and the format of the result you are looking for. Chained or linked prompting can also build a more specific response which relates to what you're looking for. True or False: GPTs produce factually incorrect information True GPTs have the tendency to generate factually incorrect information, along with details that appear to be factually correct. If you do not have the ability to discern the truth of a response, relying upon GPTs to generate legal, health, or scientific content is to be avoided. Using GPTs to produce content which will be used in decision making for health, research, or government is unethical and may be illegal.","title":"Basic Prompt Enginering"},{"location":"chatgpt_prompts/#prompt-engineering","text":"This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License .","title":"Prompt Engineering"},{"location":"chatgpt_prompts/#how-do-gpts-work","text":"Read the ChatGPT Documentation Read the ChatGPT Technical Report Read the Bard Documentation ChatGPT's GPT-3.5 and GPT-v4 models use natural language prompts to elicit contextual responses.

True or False: ChatGPT has access to web browsing by default False ChatGPT cannot access the internet and is only trained until current events in September of 2021 Alpha Plugins for ChatGPT have browsing, but are waitlisted. Third-party plugins like WebChatGPT can enable browsing, but its results are not optimal. Bing Chat, and Bard both have access to the internet, and can generate responses to current events. Short, concise, prompts are better than long meandering prompts? it depends Prompts should be specific, but they do not necessarily need to be concise. Zero-shot prompts are less likely to return an accurate response than one where you prime the model, establishing a role, a task, and the format of the result you are looking for. Chained or linked prompting can also build a more specific response which relates to what you're looking for. True or False: GPTs produce factually incorrect information True GPTs have the tendency to generate factually incorrect information, along with details that appear to be factually correct. If you do not have the ability to discern the truth of a response, relying upon GPTs to generate legal, health, or scientific content is to be avoided.

Example 2: Creative writing and brainstorming \u00b6 ChatGPT excels in innovative applications. Whether you're developing a research proposal, constructing a lecture series, or strategizing a campus event, you can harness ChatGPT to cultivate original ideas, write comprehensive narratives, or devise memorable catchphrases. In ideation sessions, it can contribute various perspectives and proposals, invigorating creativity and fostering critical thinking. Research Proposal \u00b6 Suppose you're crafting a research proposal about the influence of mythical narratives on modern literature but are stuck on formulating your main hypothesis. You might use ChatGPT in this way: Modern literature research Proposal ChatGPT, I'm constructing a research proposal and I need help formulating a unique hypothesis. The research is about the influence of mythical narratives, such as those featuring wizards and magical creatures, on modern literature. Can you help refine this idea and suggest some potential research questions and methodologies? ChatGPT could then generate a refined research idea, list potential research questions, and suggest methodologies, thereby aiding in your research proposal development process. Campus sustainability campaign \u00b6 Imagine you're brainstorming ideas for a new campus sustainability campaign. You might prompt ChatGPT as follows: Campus sustainability campaign ChatGPT, I need some creative ideas for a sustainability campaign promoting eco-friendly practices on our campus. The campaign should emphasize our institution's commitment to sustainable practices and our role in promoting environmental responsibility. Can you suggest some innovative strategies, potential catchphrases, and engaging events? ChatGPT can then provide a variety of strategies, memorable catchphrases, and event ideas to stimulate your brainstorming session, offering different perspectives and creative solutions. Example 3: Programming help \u00b6 Another impressive application of ChatGPT is in the field of programming. You can use it as a coding assistant, where it can help write code, debug issues, or explain complex code snippets. By asking it to convert your high-level descriptions into code, or to suggest improvements for existing code, you can significantly enhance your programming productivity. Coding Assistant \u00b6 Suppose you're working on a Python program to perform data analysis, but you're not sure how to write a function to calculate the median from a list of numbers. You might use ChatGPT like this: Python median function ChatGPT, I'm trying to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the median. I'm not sure about the best way to implement this. Could you help me write the code? ChatGPT could then provide you with a suitable Python function, demonstrating the logic to calculate the median from a list of numbers. Debugging \u00b6 Let's say you're having trouble with a piece of JavaScript code that's not behaving as expected. You could ask ChatGPT for help as follows: Debugging JavaScript ChatGPT, my JavaScript code to add event listeners to buttons isn't working as expected. Here's the code: let buttons = document . querySelectorAll ( '.btn' ); for ( let i = 0 ; i < buttons . length ; i ++ ) { buttons [ i ]. addEventListener ( 'click' , function () { console . log ( 'Button ' + i + ' clicked' ); }); } When I click a button, it always logs 'Button 5 clicked', no matter which button I click. What's going wrong, and how can I fix it?\" ChatGPT could then explain the issue (in this case, a common pitfall with JavaScript closures) and suggest a corrected version of your code. Limitations Remember, while ChatGPT is knowledgeable in many programming languages and concepts, it doesn't replace a full Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or debugger and should be used as a supplementary tool for coding assistance.

There is already a large list of potential uses for ChatGPT in higher education. Read about OpenAI Educator Considerations ChatGPT's GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models can compose essays and pass advanced knowledge assessments (OpenAI ) . Online education, a recent and lucrative innovation in academia, now faces challenges regarding effective remote student assessment (Susnjak ) . Attempting to modify coursework to avoid assessment techniques where ChatGPT excels or using bots to detect ChatGPT generated content may prove to be futile. Instead of engaging in a cheating arms race, why not embrace ChatGPT and other AI frameworks? Proponents of integrating ChatGPT into educational curricula ( ) argue that by adapting and integrating ChatGPT into the curriculum, we can develop a modern workforce empowered by AI assistants. I find myself aligned with this perspective (as does my AI text editor, ChatGPT-4).

As an advisor, it is important to ensure that students have appropriate access to these platforms and a comprehensive understanding of the ethical implications for their education, research, and software engineering. Platforms like ChatGPT could potentially become the primary mentor for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Unlike human advisors, these AI systems are available 24/7 to address virtually any question or problem. However, it is essential to strike a balance between AI assistance and independent learning. To achieve this balance, advisors should: Encourage AI literacy : Provide students with resources and opportunities to learn about AI technologies, their applications, and their limitations. Teach responsible AI usage : Emphasize the importance of using AI as a tool to support research, not replace critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Discuss ethical considerations : Foster open discussions about the ethical implications of AI in research, including issues of bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability. Promote collaboration : Encourage students to collaborate with AI, leveraging its strengths to overcome their weaknesses and vice versa. Stay updated : As AI technologies continue to evolve, ensure that both advisors and students stay informed about the latest developments, best practices, and potential pitfalls. By incorporating AI into graduate and postdoctoral training while maintaining a focus on ethics and responsibility, the next generation of researchers can harness the power of AI to advance their fields while upholding the highest standards of academic integrity. I will no longer approve graduate student dissertation proposals or dissertations unless they used ChatGPT or a similar AI to help them write part of it! (With appropriate acknowledgment).

In low- and middle-income countries, teachers face the challenge of making a dense curriculum engaging. To help with this, ChatGPT/Bard can translate learning objectives into lesson plans, offer ideas for class preparation, and aid in creating new assignments and assessments. However, ChatGPT/Bard does not assist with delivery, so teachers must still have strong teaching skills to ensure quality lessons. Create assessment questions . ChatGPT/Bard can help teachers improve assessment questions and generate multiple-choice items. It can also encourage higher-order thinking skills by providing prompts for essay questions and practical tasks. By using different types of assessment, teachers can help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaborative skills. Support with language barriers . The ideal scenario is for teachers to instruct in their native language, but some education systems are shifting towards teaching in a second language, such as English, even when evidence suggests the opposite approach. In such situations, teachers who are not proficient in English struggle to teach effectively. A proposed solution is the use of chatbots to enhance teachers' language proficiency, enabling them to teach better in both their native and a foreign language. Tools like Duolingo and ChatGPT reportedly provide affordable, accessible, and highly personalized language lessons. Provide additional support to students .
