## OpenAI API

!!! Tip "Get on the OpenAI GPT-4 API waitlist"

    API access to `GPT-4` is in high demand, OpenAI has created a waitlist for being granted access.

    To get on the waitlist, go to: [https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api){target=_blank} 

    Make sure you use an academic email address and clearly specify what your use cases are.

    **Important** `GPT-4` and beta models use large numbers of tokens per run. Current limits for `GPT-4-8K` has a context length of 8,192 tokens, and `GPT-4-32K` goes up to 32,768 tokens which works out to about 50 pages of text. Google Bard only accepts 2,048 tokens.
