# Applications with Google Bard

Google was caught off guard by the release and success of ChatGPT. It has since released their own competitor [BARD](https://bard.google.com/){target=_blank}, which has much of the same functionality as the new [Microsoft Bing](bing.md). 
 
While BARD [initially stumbled when it was first announced](https://time.com/6254226/alphabet-google-bard-100-billion-ai-error/){target=_blank}, the simple fact remains: Google handles over 85% of the world's search requests. 
 
Like Microsoft, Google is planning on integrating BARD with their [Google Workspace (Drive, Sheets, Docs, etc.)](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai){target=_blank}.    

This guide will help you set up Google Bard and get started using it.

## Setting up Google Bard

1. To set up Google Bard, visit [bard.google.com](https://bard.google.com/){target=_blank}.

2. If you are not already signed in to your Google Account, click **Sign in** at the top right corner of the page. If you do not have a Google Account, create one at [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com/){target=_blank}.

3. After signing in, you should be able to access Google Bard and begin using its features.

## Troubleshooting Sign-In Issues

If you encounter issues signing in to your Google Account in Bard, follow the steps outlined in Google's [support documentation](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13278668?hl=en){target=_blank}.

## Availability

Google Bard initially rolled out access in the U.S. and U.K., and is continuously expanding to [more countries and languages](https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/){target=_blank}.

For University managed accounts (`netid@arizona.edu`) Bard requires access via the Google Workspace be activated by an administrator. As of 5/26/23 UArizona administrators have not activated this feature in the UArizona Google Workspace. 

You can however use Bard through a `name@gmail.com` address.
